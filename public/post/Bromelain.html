<hr>
<h3 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h3>
<p>Bromelain is a heterogeneous group of proteolytic enzymes predominantly extracted from the stem, fruit, and leaves of <em>Ananas comosus</em> (pineapple). Since the mid‑20th century, bromelain has attracted scientific interest due to its anti‑inflammatory, fibrinolytic, antithrombotic, and immunomodulatory properties. The present review synthesizes current evidence on the pharmacological benefits of bromelain, its adverse symptom profile, and the principal food sources that deliver clinically relevant doses.</p>

<p>The enzymatic activity is quantified in “units” (U), defined by the International Association for the Properties of Water (IAPWS). Commercial preparations often range from 100 to 800 U per capsule. Oral bioavailability is limited by gastric acidity; encapsulation or formulation with pH‑stabilizers increases systemic absorption.</p>

<p><strong>Clinical Guidance:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For anti‑inflammatory or post‑operative indications, a cumulative dose of <strong>800–1200 U/day</strong> is generally effective.</li>
<li>When used concomitantly with anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin), maintain the lower end of the dosage spectrum and monitor INR levels closely.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 id="6-mechanistic-insights">6. Mechanistic Insights</h3>
<p>Bromelain’s proteolytic activity preferentially targets extracellular matrix proteins such as fibronectin, laminin, and collagen fragments that accumulate during inflammation. By cleaving these substrates, bromelain reduces tissue edema and facilitates clearance of inflammatory mediators. Additionally, the enzyme activates plasminogen to plasmin, enhancing fibrinolysis and counteracting thrombus formation without directly affecting coagulation factors I–VIII.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="7-limitations-and-future-directions">7. Limitations and Future Directions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Heterogeneity of Preparations:</strong> Commercial products vary in potency; standardized assays are required for clinical comparability.</li>
<li><strong>Long‑Term Safety Data:</strong> Most trials span ≤12 weeks; chronic use studies are scarce.</li>
<li><strong>Drug Interaction Profiling:</strong> Comprehensive pharmacokinetic interaction studies with common cardiovascular drugs remain needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Future research should focus on high‑dose, long‑term randomized controlled trials to delineate safety thresholds and refine dosing algorithms for specific patient populations (e.g., those on antithrombotic therapy).</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="8-conclusion">8. Conclusion</h3>
<p>Bromelain represents a biologically active phytochemical with demonstrable anti‑inflammatory, fibrinolytic, and immunomodulatory properties. When administered within the recommended dosage range, it offers symptomatic relief for edema, post‑operative swelling, and certain allergic conditions, while maintaining an acceptable safety profile. Clinicians should weigh its benefits against potential gastrointestinal disturbances and drug interactions, particularly in patients receiving anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents.</p>
