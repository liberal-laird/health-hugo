<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Nattokinase is a serine protease extracted from the Japanese fermented soybean product <em>natto</em>. Over the past two decades, pre‑clinical and clinical investigations have suggested that nattokinase exerts potent fibrinolytic activity, improves endothelial function, and may confer protective effects against cardiovascular disease. This review synthesizes current evidence on the biochemical mechanisms underlying these actions, summarizes key therapeutic benefits observed in human studies, discusses potential adverse events and contraindications, and highlights practical dietary sources for achieving effective plasma concentrations.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Traditional pharmacotherapies—anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, and fibrinolytics—carry significant bleeding risks. Consequently, there is growing interest in naturally derived enzymes that can modulate coagulation with a more favorable safety profile. Nattokinase (NK), first isolated by Ueno et al. (1989) from <em>Bacillus subtilis</em> natto, has emerged as one of the most studied natural fibrinolytic agents.</p>

<h3 id="21-fibrinolytic-activity">2.1 Fibrinolytic Activity</h3>
<p>NK cleaves fibrin at multiple sites, generating antifibrinolytic fragments that inhibit thrombin generation and accelerate clot breakdown. Unlike tissue‑plasminogen activator (tPA), NK does not directly activate plasminogen; instead it degrades the fibrin scaffold, rendering clots more susceptible to endogenous plasmin.</p>
<h3 id="22-endothelial-modulation">2.2 Endothelial Modulation</h3>
<p>In vitro studies demonstrate that NK upregulates endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression, increasing nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability. NO dilates vessels, reduces platelet aggregation, and inhibits smooth‑muscle proliferation—key processes in atherogenesis.</p>
<h3 id="23-antiinflammatory-effects">2.3 Anti‑Inflammatory Effects</h3>
<p>NK has been shown to down‑regulate pro‑inflammatory cytokines (IL‑6, TNF‑α) in endothelial cell cultures, potentially attenuating vascular inflammation that contributes to plaque instability.</p>

<li><strong>Gastrointestinal stability:</strong> NK is resistant to pepsin and trypsin due to its compact structure; hence oral bioactivity is preserved.</li>
<li><strong>First‑pass metabolism:</strong> Minimal hepatic clearance reported in animal studies; human data suggest measurable plasma activity after ingestion of natto.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="7-practical-recommendations-for-clinicians">7. Practical Recommendations for Clinicians</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Patient Selection</strong> – Ideal candidates are individuals with mild hypertension, dyslipidemia, or a history of transient ischemic attacks who wish to explore adjunctive natural therapies.</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring</strong> – Baseline coagulation profile (PT/INR), liver function tests, and blood pressure should be reassessed at 4–6 weeks after initiation.</li>
<li><strong>Education</strong> – Counsel patients on the importance of reporting any bleeding events or use of additional anticoagulants.</li>
<li><strong>Quality Assurance</strong> – Recommend products that provide standardized IU values and are certified for purity to reduce soy allergen contamination.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="8-conclusion">8. Conclusion</h2>
<p>Nattokinase represents a promising, naturally derived fibrinolytic agent with evidence supporting its efficacy in lowering blood pressure, improving lipid profiles, and reducing ischemic risk. While the safety profile appears favorable, clinicians should remain vigilant regarding potential interactions with conventional anticoagulants and contraindications in bleeding disorders. Further large‑scale, double‑blind RCTs are warranted to refine dosing strategies and establish long‑term outcomes.</p>
