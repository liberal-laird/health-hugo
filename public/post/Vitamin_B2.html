<hr>
<h3 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h3>
<p>Riboflavin, known scientifically as vitamin B₂, is a water‑soluble member of the B‑vitamin family that participates in critical metabolic pathways. Since its discovery in the early twentieth century, riboflavin has been recognized for its essentiality in cellular energy production, antioxidant defense, and the maintenance of healthy mucous membranes. This review synthesizes current evidence regarding the biochemical functions of vitamin B₂, outlines clinical conditions associated with both deficiency and excess, and discusses practical implications for nutrition and public health.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="2-biochemical-foundations">2. Biochemical Foundations</h3>
<h4 id="21-molecular-structure-and-dietary-sources">2.1 Molecular Structure and Dietary Sources</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Structure</strong>: Riboflavin contains a isoalloxazine ring linked to a ribitol side chain; its two active coenzyme forms are flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD).</li>
<li><strong>Food Supply</strong>: Rich sources include dairy products, organ meats, eggs, green leafy vegetables, legumes, and fortified cereals. Bioavailability is influenced by food matrix, cooking methods, and individual absorption capacity.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="22-redox-cofactor-roles">2.2 Redox Cofactor Roles</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enzymatic Participation</strong>: FMN and FAD act as electron carriers in oxidative phosphorylation (succinate‑CoA oxidoreductase) and fatty acid oxidation (acyl‑CoA dehydrogenases).</li>
<li><strong>Metabolic Pathways</strong>: They are indispensable for the catabolism of carbohydrates, lipids, and amino acids, thereby sustaining ATP production.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="23-antioxidant-and-antiinflammatory-functions">2.3 Antioxidant and Anti‑Inflammatory Functions</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Glutathione Regeneration</strong>: Riboflavin-dependent enzymes support the conversion of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) back to its reduced form (GSH), a key antioxidant.</li>
<li><strong>Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Modulation</strong>: By influencing mitochondrial respiration, riboflavin indirectly modulates ROS generation and mitigates oxidative stress.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 id="3-clinical-significance">3. Clinical Significance</h3>
<h4 id="31-deficiency-states">3.1 Deficiency States</h4>
<p>Riboflavin deficiency is uncommon in developed nations but remains a public‑health concern in regions with limited dietary diversity or high alcohol consumption.</p>
<table>
  <thead>
      <tr>
          <th><strong>Clinical Manifestations</strong></th>
          <th><strong>Pathophysiology</strong></th>
      </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
      <tr>
          <td><strong>Mucocutaneous lesions</strong> (cheilosis, glossitis)</td>
          <td>Impaired epithelial cell turnover due to inadequate ATP synthesis.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td><strong>Photophobia and ocular changes</strong> (conjunctivitis, corneal vascularization)</td>
          <td>Defective riboflavin‑dependent enzymes in ocular tissues reduce antioxidant capacity.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td><strong>Dermatitis</strong> (scaly rash around hair follicles)</td>
          <td>Compromised skin barrier function linked to impaired fatty acid metabolism.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td><strong>Anemia and leukopenia</strong></td>
          <td>Reduced nucleotide synthesis affecting hematopoiesis; evidence suggests a role in erythrocyte membrane stability.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td><strong>Neurologic disturbances</strong> (paresthesia, ataxia)</td>
          <td>Mitochondrial dysfunction in peripheral nerves leads to energy deficits.</td>
      </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<ul>
<li><strong>Diagnostic Markers</strong>: Plasma riboflavin concentration (&lt;0.5 µmol/L), urinary excretion of FMN, and functional assays such as erythrocyte glutathione reductase activity.</li>
<li><strong>Treatment Regimen</strong>: Oral supplementation (200–400 mg/day) restores plasma levels within 1–2 weeks; high‑dose therapy may be required in severe cases or when absorption is compromised.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="32-excessive-intake">3.2 Excessive Intake</h4>
<p>Although riboflavin is generally regarded as safe, chronic intake exceeding the upper tolerable limit (30 mg/day for adults) can cause:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fluorescent yellow discoloration of urine</strong>: A harmless diagnostic sign.</li>
<li><strong>Mild gastrointestinal disturbances</strong> in rare cases; no clinically significant toxicity has been documented even at high doses.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 id="4-riboflavin-and-disease-prevention">4. Riboflavin and Disease Prevention</h3>
<h4 id="41-cardiovascular-health">4.1 Cardiovascular Health</h4>
<p>Riboflavin’s role in homocysteine metabolism (via the transsulfuration pathway) may reduce cardiovascular risk. Epidemiological studies indicate an inverse relationship between dietary riboflavin intake and incidence of ischemic heart disease.</p>
<h4 id="42-neurodegenerative-disorders">4.2 Neurodegenerative Disorders</h4>
<p>Preclinical research suggests that adequate riboflavin status protects against oxidative damage in neuronal tissues, potentially lowering the risk of Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. However, large‑scale human trials are pending.</p>
<h4 id="43-cancer-prevention">4.3 Cancer Prevention</h4>
<p>Some observational studies have linked higher riboflavin intake to reduced colorectal cancer incidence, possibly through enhanced DNA repair mechanisms mediated by FAD-dependent enzymes. Further mechanistic investigations are warranted.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="5-public-health-considerations">5. Public Health Considerations</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fortification Policies</strong>: Many countries mandate fortification of staple foods (e.g., milk, bread) with riboflavin, which has markedly reduced deficiency prevalence.</li>
<li><strong>Target Populations</strong>: Pregnant women, the elderly, individuals on restrictive diets, and alcoholics should be screened routinely for riboflavin status.</li>
<li><strong>Dietary Counseling</strong>: Emphasize consumption of dairy, eggs, legumes, and green vegetables; educate about cooking methods that preserve vitamin integrity (e.g., minimal boiling time).</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 id="6-conclusion">6. Conclusion</h3>
<p>Vitamin B₂ is a pivotal micronutrient that sustains energy metabolism, protects against oxidative stress, and maintains mucosal and ocular health. While deficiency remains uncommon in affluent societies, it continues to pose significant risks in vulnerable populations worldwide. Continued research into its mechanistic roles and potential therapeutic applications will further clarify the scope of riboflavin’s contributions to human health.</p>
