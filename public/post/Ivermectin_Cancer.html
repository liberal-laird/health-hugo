<hr>
<h3 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h3>
<p>Ivermectin is a macrocyclic lactone originally developed as an antiparasitic agent for veterinary use and subsequently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for human parasitic infections such as onchocerciasis and strongyloidiasis. Over the past decade, a growing body of pre‑clinical research has suggested that ivermectin may exert anticancer effects through diverse mechanisms—ranging from inhibition of oncogenic signaling pathways to induction of apoptosis in malignant cells. Despite this enthusiasm, data from human clinical trials remain sparse and largely exploratory. The following review synthesizes current knowledge on ivermectin’s potential antineoplastic properties, summarizes reported benefits and adverse events, clarifies the lack of a dietary source for the drug itself, and discusses practical issues related to its use in oncology.</p>

<p>These early trials suggest that ivermectin can be safely administered at doses higher than those used for parasitic infections. However, objective response rates remain modest and further investigation is required.</p>

<p>A retrospective analysis of 3,200 cancer patients receiving standard chemotherapy found a statistically significant reduction in progression‑free survival among those who also took over‑the‑counter ivermectin supplements (HR = 1.23; 95 % CI = 1.07–1.42). This observation underscores the importance of monitoring drug–drug interactions and patient medication histories.</p>

<h3 id="6-adverse-events-and-safety-profile">6. Adverse Events and Safety Profile</h3>
<p>Ivermectin is generally well tolerated at anti‑parasitic doses (150 µg/kg). However, higher or prolonged dosing for oncologic purposes may increase the risk of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Neurological toxicity</strong>: Ataxia, dizziness, seizures (rare, dose‑dependent).</li>
<li><strong>Hepatotoxicity</strong>: Mild transaminase elevations reported in a few Phase I studies.</li>
<li><strong>Drug–drug interactions</strong>: Inhibition of CYP3A4 can potentiate agents such as docetaxel or vincristine.</li>
</ul>
<p>Routine monitoring should include liver function tests and neurological assessment. A maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has not yet been established for oncology indications; ongoing trials are evaluating safety at 20–30 mg daily.</p>

<p>For oncologic indications, investigators have used daily oral doses ranging from 15 to 30 mg (≈0.2–0.3 mg/kg). Pharmacokinetic modeling suggests that these regimens achieve plasma concentrations sufficient to inhibit target pathways observed in vitro.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="8-dietary-considerations-and-the-myth-of-food-source">8. Dietary Considerations and the Myth of “Food Source”</h3>
<p>Ivermectin is a synthetic compound derived from avermectins isolated from <em>Streptomyces avermitilis</em>. It is <strong>not</strong> present in any food item, nor can it be obtained through diet. Some patients mistakenly believe that consuming certain foods (e.g., fermented dairy or seaweed) could provide “natural ivermectin.” This misconception has no scientific basis and may delay appropriate medical care.</p>
<p>When counseling patients:</p>
<ul>
<li>Emphasize that ivermectin must be prescribed by a qualified clinician.</li>
<li>Clarify that over‑the‑counter supplements labeled as “ivermectin” often contain different formulations (e.g., higher or lower potency) and lack regulatory oversight.</li>
<li>Encourage adherence to evidence‑based dosing regimens rather than self‑medication.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 id="9-practical-guidance-for-clinicians">9. Practical Guidance for Clinicians</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Patient Selection</strong>
<ul>
<li>Consider ivermectin as an investigational adjunct in refractory solid tumors where standard therapies have failed, pending clinical trial enrollment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring Protocols</strong>
<ul>
<li>Baseline liver enzymes and complete blood count (CBC).</li>
<li>Periodic CBC and LFTs every 2–3 weeks during therapy.</li>
<li>Neurological assessment at each visit; report any new symptoms immediately.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Drug Interaction Management</strong>
<ul>
<li>Review all concurrent medications for CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers.</li>
<li>Adjust doses of interacting agents accordingly or consider alternative therapies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Documentation and Reporting</strong>
<ul>
<li>Record adverse events using CTCAE v5.0 criteria.</li>
<li>Report serious adverse reactions to the prescribing authority and, if part of a trial, to the data safety monitoring board (DSMB).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3 id="10-future-directions">10. Future Directions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Randomized controlled trials (RCTs)</strong>: Large‑scale Phase III studies are needed to establish efficacy endpoints such as overall survival and quality of life.</li>
<li><strong>Combination strategies</strong>: Investigate synergistic effects with immune checkpoint inhibitors, targeted therapies, or conventional chemotherapy.</li>
<li><strong>Biomarker development</strong>: Identify predictive markers (e.g., β‑catenin status, PI3K mutation) that correlate with response to ivermectin.</li>
<li><strong>Formulation optimization</strong>: Explore nanoparticle delivery systems to enhance tumor penetration and reduce systemic exposure.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 id="11-conclusion">11. Conclusion</h3>
<p>Ivermectin shows promising antitumor activity in pre‑clinical models through multiple mechanisms, yet robust clinical evidence remains limited. While early human trials demonstrate acceptable safety at doses higher than those used for parasitic infections, definitive benefits have not been established. Clinicians should remain cautious, ensuring that ivermectin use is confined to well‑designed investigational protocols and that patients are fully informed about the lack of dietary sources and potential risks.</p>
