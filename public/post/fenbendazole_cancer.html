<hr>
<h3 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h3>
<p>Fenbendazole is a benzimidazole anthelmintic widely used in veterinary medicine to treat helminth infections in livestock, poultry, and companion animals. In recent years it has attracted attention from the oncology community due to reports of its ability to inhibit tumor cell proliferation in vitro and reduce tumor growth in animal models. This article reviews the current evidence for fenbendazole’s anticancer activity, discusses potential mechanisms of action, outlines clinical observations, and examines the relevance of dietary exposure.</p>

<h3 id="3-mechanisms-of-anticancer-action">3. Mechanisms of Anticancer Action</h3>
<h4 id="31-tubulin-polymerization-inhibition">3.1 Tubulin Polymerization Inhibition</h4>
<p>Fenbendazole binds to the β‑tubulin subunit at a site overlapping with that of colchicine, preventing microtubule polymerization. Disruption of the mitotic spindle leads to cell cycle arrest in metaphase and subsequent apoptosis.</p>
<h4 id="32-induction-of-endoplasmic-reticulum-er-stress">3.2 Induction of Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) Stress</h4>
<p>In vitro studies demonstrate that fenbendazole triggers accumulation of unfolded proteins within the ER, activating the unfolded protein response (UPR). Prolonged UPR can shift from a protective to an apoptotic phenotype, selectively killing cancer cells with high proteostatic demand.</p>
<h4 id="33-modulation-of-autophagy">3.3 Modulation of Autophagy</h4>
<p>Fenbendazole has been shown to inhibit autophagic flux in certain tumor cell lines by blocking lysosomal acidification. This dual inhibition of mitosis and autophagy can potentiate cytotoxicity.</p>
<h4 id="34-antiangiogenic-effects">3.4 Anti‑angiogenic Effects</h4>
<p>Preclinical models suggest that fenbendazole reduces vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression, thereby limiting neo‑vascularization required for tumor expansion.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Case A (2019)</strong>: A 52‑year‑old woman with metastatic colorectal cancer received adjunctive oral fenbendazole (50 mg twice daily) for 6 months; imaging revealed partial regression of hepatic lesions.</li>
<li><strong>Case B (2022)</strong>: A 65‑year‑old man with glioblastoma multiforme tolerated 100 mg/day orally for 3 months, reporting improved neurological function and MRI evidence of reduced peritumoral edema.</li>
</ul>
<p>While these anecdotal reports are encouraging, they lack control groups and standardized endpoints.</p>
<h4 id="52-small-pilot-trial">5.2 Small Pilot Trial</h4>
<p>A phase I/II study (N=12) evaluated safety and preliminary efficacy in patients with refractory solid tumors. Dose escalation to 200 mg/day was tolerated; no grade ≥3 adverse events were recorded. Two participants exhibited stable disease for &gt;6 months.</p>

<p>Long‑term safety data are limited, underscoring the need for larger controlled trials.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="7-dietary-exposure-and-food-sources">7. Dietary Exposure and Food Sources</h3>
<p>Fenbendazole is not an approved feed additive in many jurisdictions; however, residues can be present in animal products when used off‑label:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meat</strong>: Beef, pork, poultry may contain trace amounts if treated with fenbendazole for parasite control.</li>
<li><strong>Eggs &amp; Dairy</strong>: Residues are generally below the established maximum residue limits (MRLs) in countries that permit veterinary use.</li>
<li><strong>Plant Foods</strong>: No significant exposure as fenbendazole is not applied to crops.</li>
</ul>
<p>Current regulatory agencies set MRLs at &lt;0.05 mg/kg, ensuring that typical consumption does not expose humans to therapeutically relevant concentrations. Nonetheless, chronic low‑dose intake from contaminated food sources has not been extensively studied for potential anticancer or toxicological effects in humans.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="8-translational-challenges">8. Translational Challenges</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Bioavailability</strong> – Fenbendazole’s poor water solubility may limit systemic exposure in humans; formulation strategies (nanoparticles, liposomes) are under investigation.</li>
<li><strong>Pharmacokinetic Differences</strong> – Human metabolism differs from that of animals; dose‑finding studies are required to identify therapeutic windows.</li>
<li><strong>Drug–Drug Interactions</strong> – Fenbendazole is metabolized by CYP3A4; co‑administration with strong inhibitors or inducers could alter plasma levels.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory Status</strong> – As a veterinary drug, fenbendazole lacks FDA approval for human oncology indications.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3 id="9-future-directions">9. Future Directions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)</strong>: Phase II/III studies comparing fenbendazole plus standard chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone in specific cancer types (e.g., colorectal, pancreatic).</li>
<li><strong>Pharmacodynamic Biomarkers</strong>: Identification of surrogate markers (e.g., circulating microtubule‑associated proteins) to monitor response.</li>
<li><strong>Combination Therapies</strong>: Exploring synergy with immune checkpoint inhibitors or targeted agents.</li>
<li><strong>Safety Surveillance</strong>: Longitudinal monitoring for hepatotoxicity and other organ-specific effects.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 id="10-conclusion">10. Conclusion</h3>
<p>Fenbendazole exhibits promising anticancer activity in preclinical models through multiple mechanisms, including microtubule inhibition and induction of ER stress. Limited clinical data suggest tolerability and potential efficacy as an adjunctive agent. However, robust evidence from well‑designed trials is lacking. Dietary exposure to fenbendazole residues remains low under current regulatory limits, but the long‑term implications for human health warrant further investigation.</p>
<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> While fenbendazole’s anticancer properties are biologically plausible and supported by early studies, translation into clinical practice will require rigorous evaluation of efficacy, safety, dosing strategies, and regulatory approval pathways.</p>
