<hr>
<h3 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h3>
<p>Thiamine (vitamin B₁) is a water‑soluble micronutrient that plays a pivotal role in cellular energy metabolism and neural function. Because it functions as an essential cofactor for several key enzymes involved in carbohydrate oxidation, its deficiency can precipitate a spectrum of clinical syndromes ranging from subtle neurocognitive disturbances to life‑threatening organ failure. This review synthesizes current evidence on the biochemical mechanisms underlying thiamine’s actions, delineates the hallmark symptoms associated with deficiency, and highlights practical considerations for prevention and management.</p>

<p>Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), the active form, is required for decarboxylation reactions that liberate energy‑rich carbon atoms from sugars. Inadequate TPP availability stalls these steps, leading to an energetic deficit particularly in tissues with high metabolic demands such as the central nervous system, myocardium, and skeletal muscle.</p>

<h3 id="9-conclusion">9. Conclusion</h3>
<p>Thiamine is indispensable for energy metabolism, neural integrity, and cardiovascular function. Its deficiency manifests across multiple organ systems, often with a rapid progression that can culminate in irreversible damage if unrecognized. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion in at-risk groups, employ timely diagnostic assays, and initiate prompt supplementation to mitigate morbidity and mortality. Continued research into optimal dosing regimens and preventive strategies will further refine care for this critical micronutrient.</p>
