<hr>
<h3 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h3>
<p>Pantothenic acid—commonly referred to as vitamin B₅—is a water‑soluble member of the B‑vitamin complex that plays an indispensable role in cellular metabolism. Unlike most other vitamins, it is ubiquitously present in both plant and animal tissues; consequently, deficiencies are rare in well‑balanced diets. Nevertheless, emerging evidence indicates that subclinical insufficiency may contribute to a spectrum of metabolic, neuropsychiatric, and dermatological disorders. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the biochemical functions of vitamin B₅, delineates its therapeutic benefits across diverse clinical conditions, and outlines characteristic symptoms associated with deficiency.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="2-biochemical-foundations">2. Biochemical Foundations</h3>
<h4 id="21-coenzyme-a-synthesis">2.1 Coenzyme A Synthesis</h4>
<p>Pantothenic acid is a precursor to coenzyme A (CoA), synthesized via the following enzymatic cascade:</p>

<p>CoA is a central cofactor in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, fatty‑acid β‑oxidation, and the synthesis of acetylcholine, steroid hormones, and non‑esterified fatty acids.</p>
<h4 id="22-acetylcoa-transferase-activity">2.2 Acetyl‑CoA Transferase Activity</h4>
<p>Acetyl‑CoA transferases, such as acetoacetyl‑CoA thiolase, rely on CoA for ketone body metabolism—a process critical during fasting or in ketogenic diets.</p>
<h4 id="23-role-in-lipid-metabolism-and-cholesterol-homeostasis">2.3 Role in Lipid Metabolism and Cholesterol Homeostasis</h4>
<p>Pantothenic acid contributes to the synthesis of cholesterol via the mevalonate pathway by providing acetyl‑CoA units. It also influences lipoprotein assembly, thereby modulating plasma lipid profiles.</p>

<p><em>Safety Considerations:</em> Pantothenic acid is generally regarded as safe; however, high‑dose oral supplementation may cause mild gastrointestinal upset or rare cases of diarrhea.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="7-future-directions">7. Future Directions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Large‑Scale RCTs</strong> are needed to establish definitive dosing regimens for neuropsychiatric and metabolic indications.</li>
<li><strong>Biomarker Development</strong>: Identification of reliable surrogate markers (e.g., plasma acylcarnitines) will facilitate early detection.</li>
<li><strong>Pharmacogenomics</strong>: Investigating genetic polymorphisms in pantothenate‑kinase genes may explain interindividual variability in response.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 id="8-conclusion">8. Conclusion</h3>
<p>Pantothenic acid remains an underappreciated yet pivotal nutrient with broad therapeutic potential. Its central role in CoA biosynthesis links it to virtually every metabolic pathway, underscoring the importance of adequate intake for optimal physiological function. While deficiency is uncommon, awareness of its clinical manifestations and evidence‑based supplementation strategies can enhance patient outcomes across a spectrum of disorders.</p>
