<hr>
<h3 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h3>
<p>Ascorbic acid (commonly known as vitamin C) is a water‑soluble micronutrient essential for human health. Although the general public often associates it with “cold‑cure” folklore, contemporary biomedical research has revealed a far more nuanced picture: vitamin C participates in enzymatic catalysis, collagen biosynthesis, neurotransmitter synthesis, and cellular redox homeostasis. This review synthesizes current evidence on its physiological roles, therapeutic potential, and safety profile, providing an academically rigorous foundation suitable for dissemination to both scientific and lay audiences.</p>

<h3 id="3-clinical-benefits">3. Clinical Benefits</h3>
<h4 id="31-immune-system-support">3.1 Immune System Support</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Evidence</strong>: Meta‑analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (Liu et al., 2022) involving &gt;4,000 participants showed a modest reduction (≈ 14 %) in the incidence and duration of common colds with daily supplementation ≥ 200 mg.</li>
<li><strong>Mechanism</strong>: Enhances phagocytic activity of neutrophils, promotes cytokine production (IL‑6, TNF‑α), and supports adaptive immunity via T‑cell proliferation.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="32-cardiovascular-health">3.2 Cardiovascular Health</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Evidence</strong>: Large cohort studies (e.g., Nurses’ Health Study) reported an inverse relationship between plasma vitamin C levels and risk of hypertension, coronary heart disease, and stroke. RCTs with high‑dose supplementation (≥ 1 g/day) demonstrated modest reductions in systolic blood pressure (~ 3–4 mmHg).</li>
<li><strong>Mechanism</strong>: Antioxidant activity reduces LDL oxidation; improves endothelial function via nitric oxide bioavailability.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="33-cancer-prevention-and-management">3.3 Cancer Prevention and Management</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Evidence</strong>: Epidemiological data suggest lower incidence of certain cancers (e.g., colorectal, lung) in populations with higher dietary vitamin C intake. However, RCTs have yielded mixed results; high‑dose intravenous vitamin C trials (≥ 5 g/kg body weight) are exploring synergistic effects with chemotherapy agents (cisplatin, paclitaxel).</li>
<li><strong>Mechanism</strong>: Generates hydrogen peroxide selectively in tumor cells (via redox cycling), induces apoptosis, and modulates immune surveillance.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="34-neurodegenerative-disorders">3.4 Neurodegenerative Disorders</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Evidence</strong>: Observational studies link higher plasma vitamin C with slower cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease. RCTs in mild cognitive impairment show improved executive function after 12‑month supplementation (500 mg/day).</li>
<li><strong>Mechanism</strong>: Reduces oxidative stress in neuronal tissue, preserves mitochondrial integrity, and modulates amyloid precursor protein processing.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="35-dermatological-applications">3.5 Dermatological Applications</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Evidence</strong>: Topical vitamin C formulations (10–20 %) accelerate wound healing, reduce scar hyperpigmentation, and improve photoaging signs. Oral supplementation improves skin elasticity by promoting collagen maturation.</li>
<li><strong>Mechanism</strong>: Directly supports collagen hydroxylation and scavenges UV‑induced ROS.</li>

<p><em>Note</em>: The RDA may not reflect the optimal level for disease prevention; many clinicians prescribe higher “therapeutic” doses based on individual risk factors.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="6-conclusion">6. Conclusion</h3>
<p>Vitamin C remains a cornerstone micronutrient with multifaceted roles spanning antioxidant defense, connective tissue integrity, immune modulation, and potential therapeutic benefits in cardiovascular disease, cancer, neurodegeneration, and dermatology. While the bulk of evidence supports safety at moderate doses, high‑dose regimens—especially intravenous administration—require careful clinical oversight. Future large‑scale RCTs will clarify its efficacy across diverse pathologies and help refine dosing guidelines for both preventive and therapeutic contexts.</p>
