<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Folic acid—also called vitamin B9—is a water‑soluble B‑vitamin essential for nucleic acid synthesis, amino‑acid metabolism, and methylation reactions. Although often perceived merely as an “antioxidant,” its biochemical functions are diverse and pivotal to numerous physiological systems. This review synthesizes current evidence on the health benefits of folate, delineates clinical manifestations of deficiency, and discusses therapeutic strategies for supplementation in various populations.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Folate is a naturally occurring compound found in leafy greens, legumes, citrus fruits, and fortified foods. Its synthetic counterpart, folic acid, is widely used in supplements and food fortification programs due to its stability and bioavailability. The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) recommends that an adult’s dietary intake should be at least 400 µg/day of dietary folate equivalents (DFE). Recent epidemiological studies have linked adequate folate status with reduced risk of neural‑tube defects, cardiovascular disease, certain cancers, and age‑related cognitive decline.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Evidence:</strong> Randomized controlled trials in the 1990s demonstrated a &gt;70 % reduction in spina bifida and anencephaly when women took 400–800 µg/day folic acid pre‑conceptionally.</li>
<li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> Folate’s role in DNA synthesis prevents chromosomal missegregation during early embryogenesis.</li>

<h3 id="32-cardiovascular-health">3.2 Cardiovascular Health</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Evidence:</strong> Meta‑analyses of cohort studies show a dose‑response relationship between serum folate and lower incidence of myocardial infarction, especially in populations with low dietary intake.</li>
<li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> Lowering homocysteine reduces endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="33-cancer-risk-modulation">3.3 Cancer Risk Modulation</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Evidence:</strong> Prospective studies indicate reduced risk for colorectal, breast, and prostate cancers among individuals with higher folate intakes. However, high supplemental doses (&gt;1 mg/day) may increase the recurrence of certain cancers (e.g., prostate).</li>
<li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> Adequate folate ensures proper DNA methylation and repair; excess can accelerate proliferation of pre‑existing neoplastic cells.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="34-neuropsychiatric-outcomes">3.4 Neuropsychiatric Outcomes</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Evidence:</strong> Randomized trials reveal modest improvements in depressive symptoms with combined B‑vitamin supplementation, including folic acid.</li>
<li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> Folate supports serotonin synthesis via the conversion of 5‑HTP to serotonin; it also reduces homocysteine, which is neurotoxic.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="35-cognitive-decline--dementia">3.5 Cognitive Decline &amp; Dementia</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Evidence:</strong> Longitudinal data suggest that higher folate status correlates with slower cognitive decline in older adults.</li>

<li><strong>Cancer Recurrence</strong> – In individuals with a history of colorectal or breast cancer, maintain folate within recommended limits (≤1 mg/day) and monitor tumor markers.</li>
<li><strong>Drug Interactions</strong> – Antiepileptics (e.g., phenytoin), methotrexate, and some antiretrovirals may increase folate requirements; adjust dosing accordingly.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="8-public-health-implications">8. Public Health Implications</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Food Fortification:</strong> Mandatory fortification of wheat flour with folic acid has reduced NTD prevalence by up to 50 % in many countries.</li>
<li><strong>Screening Programs:</strong> Targeted screening for low serum folate among pregnant women and the elderly can identify at‑risk groups early.</li>
<li><strong>Education Campaigns:</strong> Emphasize balanced diets rich in naturally occurring folates and the importance of prenatal supplementation.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="9-conclusion">9. Conclusion</h2>
<p>Vitamin B9 is indispensable for fundamental cellular processes, with far‑reaching effects on reproductive health, cardiovascular integrity, oncogenesis, and neuropsychiatric function. Adequate intake through diet or supplementation mitigates a spectrum of adverse outcomes, while deficiency manifests in hematologic, neurological, and developmental disorders. Clinicians should integrate routine folate assessment into preventive care, tailor supplementation to individual risk profiles, and remain vigilant for potential interactions and contraindications.</p>
