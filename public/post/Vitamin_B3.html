<hr>
<h3 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h3>
<p>Vitamin B₃, also known as niacin (nicotinic acid) or nicotinamide, is an essential water‑soluble nutrient that participates in more than 400 enzymatic reactions involving cellular energy metabolism, DNA repair, and neurotransmitter synthesis. Unlike most vitamins, it can be synthesized de novo from the amino acid tryptophan; however, dietary intake remains a critical source, especially for populations with restricted protein consumption or malabsorption disorders.</p>
<p>The clinical relevance of vitamin B₃ extends beyond its role as a nutritional requirement: at pharmacologic doses it is employed to manage dyslipidemia and certain dermatologic conditions. Conversely, excessive intake can provoke cutaneous flushing, hepatotoxicity, and glucose intolerance. This review systematically examines the therapeutic benefits, common indications, and potential adverse effects of vitamin B₃.</p>

<h3 id="3-therapeutic-benefits">3. Therapeutic Benefits</h3>
<h4 id="31-dyslipidemia-management">3.1 Dyslipidemia Management</h4>
<p><strong>Mechanism:</strong> Niacin activates G‑protein–coupled receptors on hepatocytes, decreasing hepatic lipogenesis and VLDL secretion. It also enhances lipoprotein lipase activity in adipose tissue, promoting clearance of triglyceride‑rich particles.</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Evidence:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Randomized controlled trials (RCTs)</strong> demonstrate a 20–30 % reduction in low‑density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‑C) and triglycerides, with an 8–15 % increase in HDL‑C.</li>
<li>The <em>Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities</em> study reported lower rates of cardiovascular events in participants receiving niacin plus statins versus statins alone, though recent trials (e.g., AIM-HIGH, HPS2‑THRIVE) failed to confirm a mortality benefit.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Current Positioning:</strong> Niacin is reserved for patients who cannot tolerate statins or require additional HDL‑C elevation. It is most effective when combined with statin therapy and lifestyle modification.</p>

<p>The anti‑inflammatory properties of niacin may explain its benefit in inflammatory skin disorders.</p>
<h4 id="33-metabolic-syndrome--insulin-resistance">3.3 Metabolic Syndrome &amp; Insulin Resistance</h4>
<p>Preclinical studies suggest that niacin improves insulin sensitivity by modulating adipokine secretion (e.g., adiponectin). Human trials, however, have shown mixed results; high‑dose niacin can worsen hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes patients.</p>
<h4 id="34-neuropsychiatric-effects">3.4 Neuropsychiatric Effects</h4>
<p>Low plasma niacin levels correlate with depressive symptoms. Small RCTs indicate that nicotinamide supplementation (500–1000 mg/day) improves mood scores, possibly via serotonin synthesis or SIRT1‑mediated neuroprotection.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Dosing Strategy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Low‑dose niacin</em> (25–50 mg/day) for general supplementation.</li>
<li><em>Therapeutic doses</em> for dyslipidemia: start at 250 mg/day, titrate up to 2 g/day over 6–8 weeks while monitoring liver function and glucose levels.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Monitoring Protocol</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Baseline LFTs, fasting lipids, fasting glucose/HbA1c.</li>
<li>Repeat labs at 4 weeks, then every 3 months during treatment.</li>
<li>Assess for flushing; counsel patients on pre‑medication strategies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Contraindications &amp; Precautions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Contraindicated in active liver disease or uncontrolled diabetes.</li>
<li>Use with caution in patients taking statins (risk of additive hepatotoxicity) and antidiabetic agents (potential glucose intolerance).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3 id="7-conclusion">7. Conclusion</h3>
<p>Vitamin B₃ is a multifaceted nutrient that bridges basic metabolic processes, cardiovascular health, dermatology, and neuropsychiatry. While its role as a dietary supplement remains essential for preventing deficiency states such as pellagra, its pharmacologic application—primarily in dyslipidemia—offers measurable benefits when carefully dosed and monitored. Clinicians should weigh the modest lipid‑modifying effects against the risk of hepatotoxicity and glucose derangements, tailoring therapy to individual patient profiles.</p>
