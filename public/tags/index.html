<p>Cholesterol is a sterol lipid that plays pivotal roles in human physiology. Although often vilified for its association with cardiovascular disease (CVD), cholesterol is indispensable for cellular integrity, hormone synthesis, bile acid formation, and vitamin D production. A nuanced understanding of its benefits, pathological consequences, and dietary origins is essential for clinicians, researchers, and public‑health practitioners alike.</p>

<p>Zinc (Zn) is an essential trace element that participates in more than 300 enzymatic reactions and plays pivotal roles in cellular proliferation, signal transduction, gene expression, and immune competence. Although required only in minute amounts—approximately 8 mg/day for adult women and 11 mg/day for adult men—the importance of maintaining adequate zinc status cannot be overstated. This review synthesises current evidence on the physiological functions of zinc, its health benefits, clinical manifestations of deficiency, and dietary strategies to optimise intake.</p>

<p>Ivermectin is a macrocyclic lactone originally developed as an antiparasitic agent for veterinary use and subsequently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for human parasitic infections such as onchocerciasis and strongyloidiasis. Over the past decade, a growing body of pre‑clinical research has suggested that ivermectin may exert anticancer effects through diverse mechanisms—ranging from inhibition of oncogenic signaling pathways to induction of apoptosis in malignant cells. Despite this enthusiasm, data from human clinical trials remain sparse and largely exploratory. The following review synthesizes current knowledge on ivermectin’s potential antineoplastic properties, summarizes reported benefits and adverse events, clarifies the lack of a dietary source for the drug itself, and discusses practical issues related to its use in oncology.</p>

Within this family, two distinct chemical forms—vitamin K₁ (phylloquinone) and vitamin K₂ (menaquinones)—exhibit divergent metabolic pathways, tissue distribution, and physiological actions. While K₁ is predominantly derived from green leafy vegetables and primarily supports coagulation, K₂ is synthesized by intestinal microbiota and present in fermented foods; it exerts broader systemic effects, notably on bone metabolism, vascular health, and cellular signaling.</p>

<p>Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) is a water‑soluble micronutrient essential for numerous biochemical pathways that underpin human health. Its unique cobalt‑containing core allows it to act as a cofactor for two critical enzymes: methylmalonyl‑CoA mutase and methionine synthase. These reactions are pivotal for energy metabolism, DNA synthesis, and nervous system integrity. Because of its central role in cellular physiology, vitamin B12 deficiency has been linked with a spectrum of clinical conditions ranging from hematologic disorders to neuropsychiatric manifestations.</p>

<p>Vitamin B₃, also known as niacin (nicotinic acid) or nicotinamide, is an essential water‑soluble nutrient that participates in more than 400 enzymatic reactions involving cellular energy metabolism, DNA repair, and neurotransmitter synthesis. Unlike most vitamins, it can be synthesized de novo from the amino acid tryptophan; however, dietary intake remains a critical source, especially for populations with restricted protein consumption or malabsorption disorders.</p>

<h3 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h3>
<p>Pantothenic acid—commonly referred to as vitamin B₅—is a water‑soluble member of the B‑vitamin complex that plays an indispensable role in cellular metabolism. Unlike most other vitamins, it is ubiquitously present in both plant and animal tissues; consequently, deficiencies are rare in well‑balanced diets. Nevertheless, emerging evidence indicates that subclinical insufficiency may contribute to a spectrum of metabolic, neuropsychiatric, and dermatological disorders. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the biochemical functions of vitamin B₅, delineates its therapeutic benefits across diverse clinical conditions, and outlines characteristic symptoms associated with deficiency.</p>

<p>Folic acid—also called vitamin B9—is a water‑soluble B‑vitamin essential for nucleic acid synthesis, amino‑acid metabolism, and methylation reactions. Although often perceived merely as an “antioxidant,” its biochemical functions are diverse and pivotal to numerous physiological systems. This review synthesizes current evidence on the health benefits of folate, delineates clinical manifestations of deficiency, and discusses therapeutic strategies for supplementation in various populations.</p>

<p>Vitamin D is a fat‑soluble secosteroid hormone that has long been recognized for its pivotal role in calcium–phosphate homeostasis and bone metabolism. In recent decades, an expanding body of evidence has illuminated its pleiotropic effects on the immune system, cardiovascular health, metabolic regulation, and even neuropsychiatric function. Consequently, vitamin D deficiency has become a global public‑health concern, with prevalence estimates ranging from 20 % to over 80 % in certain populations. This review synthesizes current knowledge regarding the therapeutic benefits of adequate vitamin D status, delineates the clinical spectrum of deficiency, and highlights gaps that warrant further investigation.</p>

<h3 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h3>
<p>Vitamin E refers to a family of eight fat‑soluble compounds (α-, β-, γ-, δ-tocopherols and tocotrienols) that share a chromanol ring and a hydrophobic side chain. Among them, α‑tocopherol is the most biologically active form in humans, largely due to its preferential retention by hepatic α‑Tocopherol Transfer Protein (α‑TTP). The antioxidant, anti‑inflammatory, and membrane‑stabilizing properties of vitamin E have prompted extensive research into its role in chronic disease prevention and treatment. This review synthesizes current evidence on the clinical benefits of vitamin E, delineates the mechanisms underlying these effects, and discusses documented adverse events associated with both deficiency and supraphysiologic supplementation.</p>

<p>Vitamin A is a fat‑soluble micronutrient belonging to the retinoid family. Its biological activities stem from its ability to act as a ligand for nuclear receptors (retinoic acid receptors, RARs; retinoid X receptors, RXRs) and as a precursor of retinaldehyde, which participates in visual phototransduction. Because of these diverse roles, vitamin A is essential for embryonic development, maintenance of epithelial integrity, immune modulation, and cellular differentiation.</p>

In vivo, these vitamers are converted into the active coenzyme pyridoxal‑5′‑phosphate (PLP), which serves as a catalytic prosthetic group for over 140 enzymatic reactions in human metabolism. Because of its central role in amino acid catabolism, neurotransmitter synthesis, hemoglobin formation, and immune modulation, vitamin B₆ is often termed “the master coenzyme.”</p>

<p>N‑acetylcysteine (NAC) is a semi‑synthetic derivative of the amino acid L‑cysteine. Its unique chemical structure—an acetylated amine group linked to the thiol side chain—confers both antioxidant properties and the capacity to replenish intracellular glutathione stores. Over the past several decades, NAC has evolved from a simple mucolytic agent into a versatile pharmacologic adjunct for diverse clinical conditions, ranging from acute hepatic failure to psychiatric disorders. This review delineates the mechanistic basis of NAC’s therapeutic effects, summarizes its symptom‑specific benefits, and identifies dietary sources that contribute to endogenous cysteine availability.</p>
