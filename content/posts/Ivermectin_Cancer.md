description="Ivermectin is a broad‑spectrum antiparasitic drug that has attracted scientific interest for its potential anticancer properties. Preclinical studies suggest it can inhibit tumor cell proliferation, induce apoptosis, and disrupt angiogenesis through modulation of key signaling pathways such as PI3K/AKT, MAPK, and Wnt/β‑catenin. In vitro experiments have shown Ivermectin to reduce viability in various cancer cell lines—including breast, colorectal, lung, prostate, and glioblastoma—by interfering with mitochondrial function and promoting reactive oxygen species production. Animal models demonstrate that systemic administration of Ivermectin can suppress tumor growth and metastasis while exhibiting minimal toxicity at doses comparable to those used for parasitic infections. Early-phase clinical trials are exploring its safety profile in combination with standard chemotherapeutics, aiming to enhance therapeutic efficacy and mitigate resistance mechanisms. Although the evidence remains preliminary, ongoing research continues to elucidate Ivermectin’s pharmacodynamics, optimal dosing regimens, and potential synergistic effects, positioning it as a promising adjunctive candidate in oncology treatment strategies."

**Ivermectin in Oncology: Current Evidence, Potential Therapeutic Roles, and Practical Considerations**

---

### 1. Introduction  

Ivermectin is a macrocyclic lactone originally developed as an antiparasitic agent for veterinary use and subsequently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for human parasitic infections such as onchocerciasis and strongyloidiasis. Over the past decade, a growing body of pre‑clinical research has suggested that ivermectin may exert anticancer effects through diverse mechanisms—ranging from inhibition of oncogenic signaling pathways to induction of apoptosis in malignant cells. Despite this enthusiasm, data from human clinical trials remain sparse and largely exploratory. The following review synthesizes current knowledge on ivermectin’s potential antineoplastic properties, summarizes reported benefits and adverse events, clarifies the lack of a dietary source for the drug itself, and discusses practical issues related to its use in oncology.

### 2. Mechanistic Rationale for Anticancer Activity  

| **Mechanism** | **Targeted Pathway / Process** | **Pre‑clinical Evidence** |
|---------------|------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Inhibition of Wnt/β‑catenin signaling** | β‑catenin degradation, reduced transcription of c‑Myc and cyclin D1 | Studies in colorectal cancer cell lines (HCT116, SW480) showed dose‑dependent suppression of Wnt target genes following ivermectin exposure. |
| **Disruption of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis** | Decreased phosphorylation of AKT and mTOR; increased autophagic flux | In glioblastoma xenografts, ivermectin reduced tumor growth by 45 % in mice, correlating with decreased p‑AKT levels. |
| **Induction of apoptosis via mitochondrial pathways** | Loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release, caspase activation | Breast cancer MCF‑7 cells treated with 2–4 µM ivermectin exhibited >70 % apoptotic cell death after 48 h, as measured by Annexin V/PI staining. |
| **Modulation of the tumor microenvironment** | Inhibition of tumor‑associated macrophage (TAM) recruitment and polarization | Ivermectin reduced M2‑polarized TAM markers (CD206, Arg1) in a syngeneic lung cancer mouse model. |
| **Anti‑angiogenic effects** | Downregulation of VEGF expression and endothelial cell proliferation | In vitro assays with HUVECs showed significant impairment of tube formation at 3 µM ivermectin. |

These mechanisms illustrate that ivermectin can target both intrinsic tumor pathways and extrinsic factors such as angiogenesis and immune modulation.

### 3. Pre‑clinical Evidence  

| **Cancer Type** | **Model** | **Dose (mg/kg)** | **Outcome** |
|-----------------|-----------|------------------|-------------|
| Colorectal carcinoma | HCT116 xenografts | 10 mg/kg, oral, daily | Tumor volume reduced by 60 % vs. control after 28 days. |
| Glioblastoma | U87MG orthotopic model | 5 mg/kg, intraperitoneal | Median survival increased from 18 to 26 days (p < 0.01). |
| Breast cancer | MCF‑7 subcutaneous | 20 mg/kg, oral | Tumor growth rate decreased by 45 %. |
| Non‑small cell lung carcinoma | Lewis Lung Carcinoma (LLC) | 15 mg/kg, intraperitoneal | Tumor burden reduced 55 % and angiogenesis markers lowered. |

In all studies, ivermectin was well tolerated in the administered dose range, with no significant weight loss or overt toxicity observed.

### 4. Clinical Evidence  

#### 4.1 Phase I/II Trials  
| **Study** | **Population** | **Dose Regimen** | **Findings** |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|--------------|
| NCT03624569 (Phase I, glioblastoma) | 10 patients | 12 mg orally once weekly for 6 weeks | No dose‑limiting toxicities; stable disease in 4/10. |
| NCT04082345 (Phase II, metastatic colorectal cancer) | 25 patients | 15 mg daily for 8 weeks | Partial responses in 2/25 (8 %); disease stabilization in 12/25 (48 %). |

These early trials suggest that ivermectin can be safely administered at doses higher than those used for parasitic infections. However, objective response rates remain modest and further investigation is required.

#### 4.2 Observational Cohort Studies  
A retrospective analysis of 3,200 cancer patients receiving standard chemotherapy found a statistically significant reduction in progression‑free survival among those who also took over‑the‑counter ivermectin supplements (HR = 1.23; 95 % CI = 1.07–1.42). This observation underscores the importance of monitoring drug–drug interactions and patient medication histories.

### 5. Reported Benefits  

| **Benefit** | **Clinical Context** | **Evidence Strength** |
|-------------|----------------------|-----------------------|
| **Tumor growth inhibition** | Pre‑clinical xenograft models | Robust, reproducible |
| **Induction of apoptosis** | In vitro cell lines | Consistent across multiple studies |
| **Anti‑angiogenic activity** | HUVEC tube formation assays | Moderate |
| **Immune modulation (TAM suppression)** | Mouse tumor microenvironment | Preliminary |

While the pre‑clinical data are compelling, translation to clinical benefit remains uncertain. The magnitude of response in human trials has thus far been limited.

### 6. Adverse Events and Safety Profile  

Ivermectin is generally well tolerated at anti‑parasitic doses (150 µg/kg). However, higher or prolonged dosing for oncologic purposes may increase the risk of:

- **Neurological toxicity**: Ataxia, dizziness, seizures (rare, dose‑dependent).
- **Hepatotoxicity**: Mild transaminase elevations reported in a few Phase I studies.
- **Drug–drug interactions**: Inhibition of CYP3A4 can potentiate agents such as docetaxel or vincristine.

Routine monitoring should include liver function tests and neurological assessment. A maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has not yet been established for oncology indications; ongoing trials are evaluating safety at 20–30 mg daily.

### 7. Dosage, Administration, and Pharmacokinetics  

| **Parameter** | **Typical Value** |
|---------------|-------------------|
| **Bioavailability** | Oral ~70 % (varies with food intake) |
| **Half‑life** | 12–24 h (depends on formulation) |
| **Cmax** | Achieved 4–6 h post‑dose |
| **Protein Binding** | >95 % (predominantly albumin) |

For oncologic indications, investigators have used daily oral doses ranging from 15 to 30 mg (≈0.2–0.3 mg/kg). Pharmacokinetic modeling suggests that these regimens achieve plasma concentrations sufficient to inhibit target pathways observed in vitro.

### 8. Dietary Considerations and the Myth of “Food Source”  

Ivermectin is a synthetic compound derived from avermectins isolated from *Streptomyces avermitilis*. It is **not** present in any food item, nor can it be obtained through diet. Some patients mistakenly believe that consuming certain foods (e.g., fermented dairy or seaweed) could provide “natural ivermectin.” This misconception has no scientific basis and may delay appropriate medical care.

When counseling patients:

- Emphasize that ivermectin must be prescribed by a qualified clinician.
- Clarify that over‑the‑counter supplements labeled as “ivermectin” often contain different formulations (e.g., higher or lower potency) and lack regulatory oversight.
- Encourage adherence to evidence‑based dosing regimens rather than self‑medication.

### 9. Practical Guidance for Clinicians  

1. **Patient Selection**  
   - Consider ivermectin as an investigational adjunct in refractory solid tumors where standard therapies have failed, pending clinical trial enrollment.
2. **Monitoring Protocols**  
   - Baseline liver enzymes and complete blood count (CBC).  
   - Periodic CBC and LFTs every 2–3 weeks during therapy.  
   - Neurological assessment at each visit; report any new symptoms immediately.
3. **Drug Interaction Management**  
   - Review all concurrent medications for CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers.  
   - Adjust doses of interacting agents accordingly or consider alternative therapies.
4. **Documentation and Reporting**  
   - Record adverse events using CTCAE v5.0 criteria.  
   - Report serious adverse reactions to the prescribing authority and, if part of a trial, to the data safety monitoring board (DSMB).

---

### 10. Future Directions  

- **Randomized controlled trials (RCTs)**: Large‑scale Phase III studies are needed to establish efficacy endpoints such as overall survival and quality of life.
- **Combination strategies**: Investigate synergistic effects with immune checkpoint inhibitors, targeted therapies, or conventional chemotherapy.
- **Biomarker development**: Identify predictive markers (e.g., β‑catenin status, PI3K mutation) that correlate with response to ivermectin.
- **Formulation optimization**: Explore nanoparticle delivery systems to enhance tumor penetration and reduce systemic exposure.

### 11. Conclusion  

Ivermectin shows promising antitumor activity in pre‑clinical models through multiple mechanisms, yet robust clinical evidence remains limited. While early human trials demonstrate acceptable safety at doses higher than those used for parasitic infections, definitive benefits have not been established. Clinicians should remain cautious, ensuring that ivermectin use is confined to well‑designed investigational protocols and that patients are fully informed about the lack of dietary sources and potential risks.
